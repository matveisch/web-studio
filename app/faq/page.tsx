                  You have significant flexibility! You can choose your
                  preferred colors, fonts (from standard web-safe options or
                  Google Fonts), and background images. You also dictate the
                  order of the different content sections on the page. We build
                  each page custom for you â€“ there are no restrictive templates.
                  You&apos;ll also provide specific images like your logo or
                  product photos to be included.

                  You will need to provide essential information specific to
                  your needs, such as your contact details, company logo, and
                  any specific images you want featured. For the main text
                  sections (headlines, descriptions, etc.), if you don&apos;t
                  have final copy ready, we can use well-structured placeholder
                  text to build the page. However, please note (as explained in
                  question 4) that updating this text later requires coding
                  assistance unless arranged differently beforehand. We can use
                  icons and placeholder images where needed, which you would
                  replace by providing your final images to us.

                    www.yourcompany.com) is not included. You will need to
                    purchase this yourself from a domain registrar. We can offer

                    <strong>Hosting:</strong> We provide complimentary basic
                    hosting for your landing page initially. This hosting is
                    suitable for typical landing page traffic levels. If your
                    page&apos;s traffic grows significantly and requires more
                    server resources, we will discuss transitioning to a
                    standard paid hosting plan with you and can assist in
                    setting that up.

                  Typically, no. The standard landing page is built using code
                  (HTML/CSS/JS) for optimal performance and design flexibility.
                  This means changes to text, images, or layout after the site
                  is live require coding knowledge. Any updates needed after the
                  project completion would be handled as a separate request, and
                  we can provide a quote for the work involved.

                  <strong>Exception:</strong> If you know beforehand that
                  you&apos;ll need to frequently update specific sections
                  yourself (like portfolio images or promotional banners),
                  please discuss this with us <em>before</em> the project
                  starts. We can potentially build those specific parts using a
                  different method that allows easier updates, which might
                  affect the project scope and cost.
